# Matching

This implements a very simple version of the [Gale-Shapley algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm) or "deferred acceptance algorithm".
This algorithm is also famously used by the [National Resident Matching Program](https://www.nrmp.org/intro-to-the-match/how-matching-algorithm-works/) to place 
medical residents across the country.

It currently matches single applicants with locations. It cannot do pair-matching yet.
